/* Station Briefs: player-facing primers for people who want help building a character with a class-like feel.
 * One source for the website (briefs.html) and for Register With Gloss in the Foundry system, which bundles
 * this file. Briefs are starting points, not classes: take one as written, change any part, or ignore them all.
 *
 * Every Brief's skills use the standard spread (three at 2, three at 1), which costs exactly the 15 starting
 * Tenure. Traits, Hindrances and the Gift are examples. The Commendation is a suggestion for Grade II;
 * ruleBreak is one of the Commendation rule-breaks (trait2, difficulty, obstacle, conditions, impossible, dissonance).
